# EmpowrHER

# ðŸ’« Inspiration
We believe that Women in STEM are currently lacking in resources reinforcing a sense of community. As we are currently working towards a more equitable world, it is important to us to help provide a platform for women in STEM to share their skills and learn new hobbies while connecting with other like-minded women.

# ðŸ’« What it does
EmpowrHER is a skill-sharing platform addressing the needs of women in STEM. Upon viewing the landing page, you could sign in using your current Gmail account, and immediately be able to share your skills (aka. fulfill empowerment) or create a new posting to request empowerment from other Women in STEM. According to your needs and current skills, others can easily search for and contact empowerment seekers.

# ðŸ’« How we built it
We have decided to take a serverless approach for this application so that it is more accessible for empowerment purposes. In fact, we authenticate and store the data in Firebase (NoSQL paradigm), and we directly connect Firebase on our frontend. Our frontend is built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. We take a RESTful approach in the application to make sure the efficiency and security of the application. Additionally, we implement Co:here to utilize NLP to serve the users with greater strength.

# ðŸ’« Challenges we ran into
We had too much fun and so little time >:)

But seriously, we had challenges with collaborating on the same files on Github, which can easily create conflicts. However, we had so much passion for this project that we could not wait for the others to finish coding to code even more. In the end, we overcame these challenges by splitting up into groups that handle the frontend and the database.

# ðŸ’« Accomplishments that we're proud of
Braving our first hackathon together, we managed to create a full-fledged, serverless web application that creates a positive impact and reinforces the influence of women in STEM. In addition to gaining a solid foundation in the development of serverless applications, we fought the deafening urge to pack our bags and sleep. However, our determination and persistence rewarded us with a successful project that not only made us better hackers, but will make a dent in destigmatizing the STEM field for women.

# ðŸ’« What we learned
The value of collaboration and networking: Building EmpowrHER has demonstrated the importance of collaboration and networking for professional and personal growth, and how a platform like EmpowrHER can be a powerful tool for connecting and collaborating with others in the field.

# ðŸ’« What's next for EmpowrHER
Our next steps could include partnering with companies and organizations to provide more job and internship opportunities for members: By partnering with companies and organizations, EmpowrHER could provide more job and internship opportunities for members, and help bridge the gap between education and employment in STEM fields.
